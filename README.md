Peppe
=====

Peppe is a time-lapse photographer for the Raspberry Pi (or indeed any computer)

### Setup ###

* Make sure you have python version 3 or greater installed, and a corresponding version of `pip`

* Install the python interface to dropbox. On Ubuntu 13.04:  
	sudo pip3 install dropbox

* Install `gphoto2` (available in repositories)

* Create a Dropbox account if you don't already have one

* Connect your camera via USB

* Run peppe.py!


### Recommendations ###

* Disable your camera's auto-sleep function (or make it longer than the photo period)
